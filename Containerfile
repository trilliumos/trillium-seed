# In order to make a base image as part of a Dockerfile, this container build uses
# nested containerization, so you must build with e.g.
# podman build -v "$(pwd):/buildcontext" --security-opt=label=disable --cap-add=all --device /dev/fuse <...>

# Note that because of how cachi2 manages the repo files, we can't
# do the separate "repos container" pattern.
